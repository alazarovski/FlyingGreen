Output

The Environmental costs vary depending on the Zone selected andthe What if simulation. The Environmental cost are visible for 3 years:

2030, 2040 and 2050.​

Data

Data to calculate additional environmental costs are synchronized withassumptions from Eurocontrol Aviation Outlook 2050 (see below).​

EU ETS cost are assumed to offset the total remaining net emissions,both taking into consideration LCA values (option EU ETS), and nottaking into consideration SAF lifecycle values (the option with SAFexcluded). ​

Simplified CORSIA costs only appear if emission values for eligibleflights are higher than 85% of 2019 emissions and then takingCORSIA sectoral growth factors into consideration (linear progressionfrom zero towards SGF 2,6 in 2050). Only sectoral offsetmethodologies are included to avoid too high calculation complexities.​
